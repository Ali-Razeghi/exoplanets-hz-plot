# Exoplanets — Habitable Zone Scatter Plot

This Python script downloads **real exoplanet data** from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and plots planets based on their **insolation (S⊕)** and **radius (R⊕)**.  
Small planets (≤ 1.8 R⊕) within a **simple habitable zone range** (0.35–1.5 S⊕) are highlighted.
